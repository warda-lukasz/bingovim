# Bingovim! 💀

This is my configuration for neovim 🤯. 
It is a work in progress (as it always is 😥) and I am constantly tweaking it (as always as it is also 😫).
It uses Lazy package manager 📦, which I heard is what the cool kids are using  😎🆒.

## Installation 🚀

1. Clone this repository to your `~/.config/nvim` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/warda-lukasz/bingovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
2. Open neovim (and in case it is not, then `:Lazy sync` to install all plugins).

3. Done!  🏅🔥🎉
