# Bingovim!

This is my configuration for neovim. It is a work in progress (as always) and I am constantly tweaking it (as always also).
It uses Lazy package manager, which I heard is what the cool kids are using.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your `~/.config/nvim` directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/warda-lukasz/bingovim.git ~/.config/nvim
```
2. Open neovim (and in case it is not, then `:Lazy sync` to install all plugins).

3. Done!
